[Roger Stein: A bold new way to fund drug research](https://www.ted.com/talks/roger_stein_a_bold_new_way_to_fund_drug_research)

[WEBVTT](http://open.163.com/movie/2014/4/D/3/M9MPLF29H_M9MRKVCD3.html)
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:900000,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:00:12.597 --> 00:00:19.112
So this is a picture of my dad and me,
at the beach in Far Rockaway,

00:00:19.136 --> 00:00:20.598
or actually Rockaway Park.

00:00:20.622 --> 00:00:23.288
I'm the one with the blond hair.

00:00:23.312 --> 00:00:25.254
My dad's the guy with the cigarette.

00:00:25.278 --> 00:00:26.429
It was the 60's.

00:00:26.453 --> 00:00:28.091
A lot of people smoked back then.

00:00:28.115 --> 00:00:31.632
In the summer of 2009,
my dad was diagnosed with lung cancer.

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:37.983
Cancer is one of those things
that actually touches everybody.

00:00:38.007 --> 00:00:40.635
If you're a man in the US,

00:00:40.659 --> 00:00:42.705
you've got about a one in two chance

00:00:42.729 --> 00:00:45.664
of being diagnosed with cancer
during your lifetime.

00:00:45.688 --> 00:00:48.473
If you're a woman, you've got
about a one in three chance

00:00:48.497 --> 00:00:50.166
of being diagnosed with cancer.

00:00:50.983 --> 00:00:54.117
Everybody knows somebody
who's been diagnosed with cancer.

00:00:55.313 --> 00:00:56.893
Now, my dad's doing better today,

00:00:56.917 --> 00:01:01.950
and part of the reason for that is that
he was able to participate in the trial

00:01:01.974 --> 00:01:05.207
of an experimental new drug
that happened to be specially formulated

00:01:05.231 --> 00:01:07.484
and very good for his particular
kind of cancer.

00:01:07.508 --> 00:01:09.281
There are over 200 kinds of cancer.

00:01:10.618 --> 00:01:12.878
And what I want to talk about today

00:01:12.902 --> 00:01:15.774
is how we can help
more people like my dad,

00:01:15.798 --> 00:01:18.752
because we have to change the way
we think about raising money

00:01:18.776 --> 00:01:20.170
to fund cancer research.

00:01:21.231 --> 00:01:23.165
So a while after my dad was diagnosed,

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:25.964
I was having coffee
with my friend Andrew Lo.

00:01:26.365 --> 00:01:29.631
He's the head of the Laboratory
for Financial Engineering at MIT,

00:01:29.655 --> 00:01:31.593
where I also have a position,

00:01:31.617 --> 00:01:33.219
and we were talking about cancer.

00:01:33.243 --> 00:01:35.637
And Andrew had been doing
his own bits of research,

00:01:35.661 --> 00:01:37.755
and one of the things
that he had been told

00:01:37.779 --> 00:01:42.224
and that he'd learned
from studying the literature

00:01:42.248 --> 00:01:44.329
was that there's actually
a big bottleneck.

00:01:44.353 --> 00:01:46.493
It's very difficult to develop new drugs,

00:01:46.517 --> 00:01:48.877
and the reason it's difficult
to develop new drugs

00:01:48.901 --> 00:01:51.322
is because in the early stages
of drug development,

00:01:51.346 --> 00:01:53.851
the drugs are very risky,
and they're very expensive.

00:01:53.875 --> 00:01:56.748
So Andrew asked me
if I'd want to maybe work with him a bit,

00:01:56.772 --> 00:01:58.882
work on some of the math and the analytics

00:01:58.906 --> 00:02:01.443
and see if we could figure out
something we could do.

00:02:02.074 --> 00:02:03.543
Now I'm not a scientist.

00:02:03.567 --> 00:02:05.615
You know, I don't know
how to build a drug.

00:02:05.639 --> 00:02:10.534
And none of my coauthors, Andrew Lo
or Jose-Maria Fernandez or David Fagnan --

00:02:10.558 --> 00:02:13.273
none of those guys are scientists either.

00:02:13.297 --> 00:02:16.326
We don't know the first thing
about how to make a cancer drug.

00:02:16.786 --> 00:02:18.985
But we know a little bit
about risk mitigation

00:02:19.009 --> 00:02:21.125
and a little bit
about financial engineering,

00:02:21.149 --> 00:02:23.257
and so we started thinking,
what could we do?

00:02:24.037 --> 00:02:25.847
I'm going to tell you about some work

00:02:25.871 --> 00:02:27.956
we've been doing
over the last couple years

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:30.251
that we think could
fundamentally change the way

00:02:30.275 --> 00:02:33.148
research for cancer
and lots of other things gets done.

00:02:33.708 --> 00:02:36.097
We want to let the research
drive the funding,

00:02:36.121 --> 00:02:37.673
not the other way around.

00:02:38.404 --> 00:02:39.698
So in order to get started,

00:02:39.722 --> 00:02:41.845
let me tell you
how you get a drug financed.

00:02:41.869 --> 00:02:46.270
Imagine that you're in your lab --
you're a scientist, you're not like me --

00:02:46.294 --> 00:02:48.266
and you've developed a new compound

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:52.146
that you think might be therapeutic
for somebody with cancer.

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:55.826
Well, what you do is, you test in animals,
you test in test tubes,

00:02:55.850 --> 00:02:58.910
but there's this notion
of going from the bench to the bedside,

00:02:58.934 --> 00:03:02.586
and in order to get from the bench,
the lab, to the bedside, to the patients,

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:04.440
you've got to get the drug tested.

00:03:04.464 --> 00:03:06.068
And the way the drug gets tested

00:03:06.092 --> 00:03:08.313
is through a series of,
basically, experiments,

00:03:08.337 --> 00:03:10.368
through these large,
they're called trials,

00:03:10.392 --> 00:03:12.747
that they do to determine
whether the drug is safe

00:03:12.771 --> 00:03:14.784
and whether it works and all these things.

00:03:14.808 --> 00:03:16.888
So the FDA has a very specific protocol.

00:03:16.912 --> 00:03:18.603
In the first phase of this testing,

00:03:18.627 --> 00:03:22.236
which is called testing for toxicity,
it's called Phase I.

00:03:22.633 --> 00:03:25.327
In the first phase,
you give the drug to healthy people

00:03:25.351 --> 00:03:27.688
and you see if it actually
makes them sick.

00:03:28.536 --> 00:03:30.930
In other words, are the side
effects just so severe

00:03:30.954 --> 00:03:32.742
that no matter how much good it does,

00:03:32.766 --> 00:03:34.224
it's not going to be worth it?

00:03:34.248 --> 00:03:36.939
Does it cause heart attacks,
kill people, liver failure?

00:03:36.963 --> 00:03:39.116
And it turns out,
that's a pretty high hurdle.

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:41.502
About a third of all drugs
drop out at that point.

00:03:41.621 --> 00:03:44.480
In the next phase, you test
to see if the drug's effective,

00:03:44.504 --> 00:03:46.294
and you give it to people with cancer

00:03:46.318 --> 00:03:48.049
and you see if it makes them better.

00:03:48.073 --> 00:03:50.391
And that's also a higher hurdle.
People drop out.

00:03:50.415 --> 00:03:53.221
And in the third phase,
you test it on a very large sample,

00:03:53.245 --> 00:03:56.353
and you're trying to determine
what the right dose is,

00:03:56.377 --> 00:03:59.579
is it better than what's available today?
If not, then why build it?

00:03:59.849 --> 00:04:01.793
When you're done with all that,

00:04:01.918 --> 00:04:04.403
what you have is a very small
percentage of drugs

00:04:04.427 --> 00:04:07.253
that start the process
actually come out the other side.

00:04:07.277 --> 00:04:10.991
So those blue bottles --
those blue bottles save lives,

00:04:11.015 --> 00:04:14.075
and they're also worth billions,
sometimes billions a year.

00:04:14.758 --> 00:04:16.333
So now here's a question:

00:04:16.357 --> 00:04:19.599
if I were to ask you, for example,

00:04:19.623 --> 00:04:23.588
to make a one-time investment of, say,
200 million dollars

00:04:23.612 --> 00:04:25.256
to buy one of those bottles,

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:28.632
so 200 million dollars up front, one time,
to buy one of those bottles,

00:04:28.656 --> 00:04:30.272
I won't tell you which one it is,

00:04:30.296 --> 00:04:34.197
and in 10 years, I'll tell you whether
you have one of the blue ones.

00:04:34.221 --> 00:04:36.352
Does that sound like a good
deal for anybody?

00:04:36.376 --> 00:04:37.614
No. No, right?

00:04:37.638 --> 00:04:40.172
And of course, it's a very,
very risky trial position,

00:04:40.196 --> 00:04:42.338
and that's why it's very hard
to get funding,

00:04:42.362 --> 00:04:45.158
but to a first approximation,
that's actually the proposal.

00:04:45.182 --> 00:04:47.792
You have to fund these things
from the early stages on.

00:04:47.816 --> 00:04:49.083
It takes a long time.

00:04:49.107 --> 00:04:52.524
So Andrew said to me, he said,

00:04:52.548 --> 00:04:54.994
"What if we stop thinking
about these as drugs?

00:04:55.018 --> 00:04:57.804
What if we start thinking
about them as financial assets?"

00:04:57.828 --> 00:05:00.472
They've got really weird payoff
structures and all that,

00:05:00.496 --> 00:05:03.836
but let's throw everything we know
about financial engineering at them.

00:05:03.860 --> 00:05:06.320
Let's see if we can use
all the tricks of the trade

00:05:06.344 --> 00:05:09.691
to figure out how to make these drugs
work as financial assets.

00:05:10.302 --> 00:05:11.748
Let's create a giant fund.

00:05:12.247 --> 00:05:14.991
In finance, we know what to do
with assets that are risky.

00:05:15.015 --> 00:05:18.127
You put them in a portfolio
and you try to smooth out the returns.

00:05:18.151 --> 00:05:21.194
So we did some math, and it turned out
you could make this work,

00:05:21.218 --> 00:05:24.650
but in order to make it work,
you need about 80 to 150 drugs.

00:05:24.674 --> 00:05:26.839
Now the good news is,
there's plenty of drugs

00:05:26.863 --> 00:05:28.323
that are waiting to be tested.

00:05:28.347 --> 00:05:32.280
We've been told that there's a backlog
of about 20 years of drugs

00:05:32.304 --> 00:05:34.757
that are waiting to be tested
but can't be funded.

00:05:34.781 --> 00:05:37.178
In fact, that early stage
of the funding process,

00:05:37.202 --> 00:05:39.174
that Phase I and preclinical stuff,

00:05:39.198 --> 00:05:42.067
that's actually, in the industry,
called the Valley of Death

00:05:42.091 --> 00:05:43.828
because it's where drugs go to die.

00:05:43.852 --> 00:05:46.106
It's very hard to for them
to get through there,

00:05:46.130 --> 00:05:48.357
and of course, if you can't
get through there,

00:05:48.381 --> 00:05:50.015
you can't get to the later stages.

00:05:50.039 --> 00:05:52.091
So we did this math,
and we figured out, OK,

00:05:52.115 --> 00:05:55.413
well, you need about 80 to, say, 150,
or something like that, drugs.

00:05:55.725 --> 00:05:58.511
And then we did a little more
math, and we said, OK,

00:05:58.535 --> 00:06:01.797
well, that's a fund of about three
to 15 billion dollars.

00:06:01.821 --> 00:06:05.305
So we kind of created a new problem
by solving the old one.

00:06:05.863 --> 00:06:08.546
We got rid of the risk,
but now we need a lot of capital,

00:06:08.570 --> 00:06:11.681
and you can only get that kind
of capital in the capital markets.

00:06:11.705 --> 00:06:14.198
Venture capitalists
and philanthropies don't have it.

00:06:14.222 --> 00:06:17.429
But we have to figure out
how to get people in the capital markets,

00:06:17.453 --> 00:06:20.945
who traditionally don't invest in this,
to want to invest in this stuff.

00:06:20.969 --> 00:06:23.287
So again, financial engineering
was helpful here.

00:06:23.311 --> 00:06:25.111
Imagine the megafund starts empty,

00:06:25.135 --> 00:06:29.144
and what it does is it issues
some debt and some equity,

00:06:29.168 --> 00:06:30.564
and that generates cash flow.

00:06:30.922 --> 00:06:34.667
That cash flow is used, then, to buy
that big portfolio of drugs that you need,

00:06:34.691 --> 00:06:38.004
and those drugs start working their way
through that approval process,

00:06:38.028 --> 00:06:40.419
and each time they go through
a phase of approval,

00:06:40.443 --> 00:06:41.638
they gain value.

00:06:41.662 --> 00:06:44.020
Most of them don't make it,
but a few of them do,

00:06:44.044 --> 00:06:46.550
and with the ones that gain
value, you can sell some,

00:06:46.574 --> 00:06:47.812
and when you sell them,

00:06:47.836 --> 00:06:50.174
you have money to pay
the interest on those bonds,

00:06:50.198 --> 00:06:52.249
but also to fund the next round of trials.

00:06:52.273 --> 00:06:53.498
It's almost self-funding.

00:06:53.522 --> 00:06:55.802
You do that for the course
of the transaction,

00:06:55.826 --> 00:06:58.255
and when you're done,
you liquidate the portfolio,

00:06:58.279 --> 00:07:01.601
pay back the bonds, and you can give
the equity holders a nice return.

00:07:01.625 --> 00:07:03.800
That was the theory,
and we talked about it,

00:07:03.824 --> 00:07:05.294
we did a bunch of experiments,

00:07:05.318 --> 00:07:07.486
and then we said,
let's really try to test it.

00:07:07.510 --> 00:07:10.394
We spent the next two years
doing research.

00:07:10.873 --> 00:07:15.241
We talked to hundreds of experts
in drug financing and venture capital.

00:07:15.679 --> 00:07:17.931
We talked to people
who have developed drugs.

00:07:17.955 --> 00:07:19.790
We talked to pharmaceutical companies.

00:07:19.814 --> 00:07:22.644
We actually looked at the data for drugs,

00:07:22.668 --> 00:07:26.840
over 2,000 drugs that had been approved
or denied or withdrawn,

00:07:26.864 --> 00:07:29.215
and we also ran millions of simulations.

00:07:30.188 --> 00:07:32.718
And all that actually took a lot of time.

00:07:32.742 --> 00:07:36.035
But when we were done, we found something
that was sort of surprising.

00:07:36.059 --> 00:07:37.885
It was feasible to structure that fund

00:07:37.909 --> 00:07:40.001
such that when you were done
structuring it,

00:07:40.025 --> 00:07:43.964
you could actually produce low-risk bonds
that would be attractive to bond holders,

00:07:43.988 --> 00:07:46.728
that would give you yields
of about five to eight percent,

00:07:46.752 --> 00:07:48.217
and you could produce equity

00:07:48.241 --> 00:07:50.936
that would give equity holders
about a 12 percent return.

00:07:50.960 --> 00:07:54.342
Now those returns aren't going
to be attractive to a venture capitalist.

00:07:54.366 --> 00:07:55.899
They want to make those big bets

00:07:55.923 --> 00:07:57.716
and get those billion dollar payoffs.

00:07:57.953 --> 00:08:01.391
But it turns out there are lots of other
folks that would be interested.

00:08:01.415 --> 00:08:04.994
That's right in the investment sweet spot
of pension funds and 401(k) plans

00:08:05.018 --> 00:08:06.316
and all this other stuff.

00:08:06.645 --> 00:08:09.117
So we published some articles
in the academic press,

00:08:09.141 --> 00:08:13.956
in medical journals, in finance journals.

00:08:13.980 --> 00:08:17.425
But it wasn't until we actually
got the popular press interested in this

00:08:17.449 --> 00:08:19.654
that we began to get some traction.

00:08:20.318 --> 00:08:22.914
We wanted to do more
than just make people aware of it.

00:08:22.938 --> 00:08:24.518
We wanted people to get involved.

00:08:24.542 --> 00:08:27.655
So we took all of our computer code
and made that available online

00:08:27.679 --> 00:08:30.367
under an open-source license
to anybody that wanted it.

00:08:30.391 --> 00:08:32.086
And you guys can download it today

00:08:32.110 --> 00:08:35.237
if you want to run your own experiments
to see if this would work.

00:08:35.261 --> 00:08:36.746
And that was really effective,

00:08:36.770 --> 00:08:39.134
because people that didn't
believe our assumptions

00:08:39.158 --> 00:08:41.309
could try their own
and see how it would work.

00:08:41.333 --> 00:08:43.319
Now there's an obvious problem, which is,

00:08:43.343 --> 00:08:45.618
is there enough money
in the world to fund this?

00:08:45.642 --> 00:08:48.559
I've told you there's enough drugs,
but is there enough money?

00:08:48.583 --> 00:08:50.489
There's 100 trillion dollars of capital

00:08:50.513 --> 00:08:53.507
currently invested
in fixed-income securities.

00:08:54.590 --> 00:08:56.423
That's a hundred thousand billion.

00:08:58.278 --> 00:08:59.885
There's plenty of money.

00:08:59.909 --> 00:09:02.915
(Laughter)

00:09:04.046 --> 00:09:06.789
But we realized it's more than
just money that's required.

00:09:06.813 --> 00:09:08.813
We had to get people motivated, involved,

00:09:08.837 --> 00:09:10.487
and get them to understand this.

00:09:10.733 --> 00:09:14.268
And we started thinking about all
the different things that could go wrong.

00:09:14.292 --> 00:09:17.154
What are all the challenges
that might get in the way?

00:09:17.178 --> 00:09:18.398
And we had a long list.

00:09:18.422 --> 00:09:21.401
We assigned a bunch of people,
including ourselves,

00:09:21.425 --> 00:09:23.011
different pieces of this problem.

00:09:23.868 --> 00:09:26.679
And we said, could you start
a work stream on credit risk?

00:09:26.703 --> 00:09:29.348
Could you start a work stream
on the regulatory aspects?

00:09:29.372 --> 00:09:33.405
Could you start a work stream
on how you would manage so many projects?

00:09:33.429 --> 00:09:37.101
And we had all these experts get together
and do these different work streams,

00:09:37.125 --> 00:09:38.973
and then we held a conference.

00:09:38.997 --> 00:09:41.227
The conference was held
over this past summer.

00:09:41.251 --> 00:09:43.031
It was an invitation-only conference.

00:09:43.055 --> 00:09:45.305
It was sponsored
by the American Cancer Society

00:09:45.329 --> 00:09:48.738
and done in collaboration
with the National Cancer Institute.

00:09:48.762 --> 00:09:51.720
We had experts from every field
we thought would be important,

00:09:51.744 --> 00:09:54.741
including the government, and people
that run research centers,

00:09:54.765 --> 00:09:57.202
and for two days they heard the reports

00:09:57.226 --> 00:09:59.818
from those five work streams,
and talked about it.

00:09:59.842 --> 00:10:02.680
It was the first time the people
who could make this happen

00:10:02.704 --> 00:10:05.771
sat across the table from each other
and had these conversations.

00:10:05.795 --> 00:10:09.292
Now these conferences,
it's typical to have a dinner,

00:10:09.316 --> 00:10:12.088
and at that dinner,
you get to know each other,

00:10:12.112 --> 00:10:13.853
sort of like what we're doing here.

00:10:13.877 --> 00:10:15.523
I happened to look out the window,

00:10:15.547 --> 00:10:16.843
and hand on my heart,

00:10:16.867 --> 00:10:19.679
on the night of this conference --
it was the summertime --

00:10:19.703 --> 00:10:21.947
and that's what I saw, a double rainbow.

00:10:21.971 --> 00:10:23.914
So I'd like to think it was a good sign.

00:10:24.040 --> 00:10:28.241
Since the conference, we've got people
working between Paris and San Francisco,

00:10:28.265 --> 00:10:30.134
lots of different folks working on this

00:10:30.158 --> 00:10:32.609
to try to see if we can
really make it happen.

00:10:32.890 --> 00:10:36.293
We're not looking to start a fund,
but we want somebody else to do this.

00:10:36.317 --> 00:10:38.487
Because, again, I'm not a scientist.

00:10:38.511 --> 00:10:40.390
I can't build a drug.

00:10:40.414 --> 00:10:44.040
I'm never going to have enough money
to fund even one of those trials.

00:10:44.401 --> 00:10:47.226
But all of us together, with our 401(k)s,

00:10:47.250 --> 00:10:49.818
with our 529 plans,
with our pension plans,

00:10:49.842 --> 00:10:52.725
all of us together can actually
fund hundreds of trials

00:10:52.749 --> 00:10:54.333
and get paid well for doing it

00:10:54.357 --> 00:10:57.104
and save millions of lives like my dad.

00:10:57.128 --> 00:10:58.279
Thank you.

00:10:58.303 --> 00:11:03.878
(Applause)
